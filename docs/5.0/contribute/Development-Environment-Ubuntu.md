# Development Environment on Ubuntu

Refer to the main guide:
[Development Environment with IntelliJ](Development-Environment-Setup.md). This page only contains some
Ubuntu specific additions.


## Java Development Kit

Install thee needed Java JDK (see dev env docu) and make sure it is the default Java version on your system.

Here's the recommended way to do it: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-java-with-apt-get-on-ubuntu-16-04

Execute `java -version` to make sure the version is the right one.


## Tomcat

Just download and unzip. Don't use `apt-get` for this.


## Node.js

Install node.js (check [Development Environment with IntelliJ](Development-Environment-Setup.md) to see which 
version we currently use). [Installation instruction](https://github.com/nodesource/distributions).

### Solve Problems with Global NPM Dependencies

Scenarioo should not need any global dependencies anymore - if everything is run thorugh our package.json (see scripts area!)!

Nevertheless, here is some old instruction how you can make global dependencies work in case of access right problems on Linux:

To prevent problems with access rights of globally installed node modules (the ones where use use `npm install -g`) we suggest to create your own folder for storing global modules. One way to achieve this is to create a folder in your home directory and set it as the prefix for global npm installs. The idea is inspired by this [Stackoverflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/a/21712034/581553).

```
mkdir ~/.npm_global
sudo npm config set prefix ~/.npm_global -g
```

If you did this, the binaries that npm installs globally will be linked from `~/.npm_global/bin`. Therefore you have to add this path to your `PATH` variable. You can do this by adding the following line to `~/.bash_aliases`.

```
export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.npm_global/bin"
```
