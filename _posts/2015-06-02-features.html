        <h3>Visual Guidebook of User Scenarios</h3>

        <p>
            Document the important user scenarios of your application with screenshots and
            arbitrary additional information generated out of your automated UI tests.
            The Scenarioo Viewer web app lets you jump, almost like a kangaroo, through the steps of the tested scenarios.
            These scenarios are grouped by use case for ease of navigation.

        <p>
            Everybody involved in the development of your software can use the Scenarioo Viewer to browse
            the generated documentation comfortably. This is a common source of information and basis for
            collaboration for product owners, business analysts, product managers, requirements engineers, testers,
            supporters, developers and operations.

        <h3>Always Up to Date</h3>

        <p>
            Scenarioo is a living documentation that is updated whenever you run your UI tests on the build server.
            Scenarioo turns your UI tests into a functional documentation of your
            software that is always in sync with what is currently implemented.

        <h3>UI Testing Toolkit Agnostic</h3>

        <p>
            Scenarioo provides a documentation format that is independent of your testing technology. It is possible to
            write Scenarioo XML files and screenshots from arbitrary UI testing toolkits and programming languages. For
            your convenience we provide a small Scenarioo Writer library that helps writing the documentation files
            from your tests written in C#, Java and JavaScript.
