# Safe Identifiers

The following fields are used as identifiers:

* branch name
* build name
* use case name
* scenario name
* page name
* object type
* object name
* label identifiers

This means, that they can also be part of a URL. And because of that, the following characters are not allowed in identifiers:
* /
* \
