# Diff Viewer

The Diff Viewer feature makes it possible to compare two different documentation builds in scenarioo against each other to see changes in your test scenarios. 

The Diff Viewer compares all the screenshots of all your tests and shows you where you have how much changes. Also it compares structural changes in your tests, like added or removed scenarios or use cases, or added or removed steps inside test scenarios.

See following sub sections for more information:

* [Diff Viewer Setup Instructions](features/diff-viewer/setup.md)
