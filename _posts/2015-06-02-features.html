	        <p>Scenarioo provides a documentation format that is independent of your testing technology. It is possible to write Scenarioo XML files and screenshots from arbitrary UI testing toolkits and programming languages. For your convenience we provide a small scenarioo docu writer library that helps writing the documentation files in your tests for C#, Java and JavaScript.</p>
