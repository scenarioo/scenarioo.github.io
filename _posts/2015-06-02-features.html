        <h3>Visual Guidebook of User Scenarios</h3>

        <p>
            Document the important user scenarios of your application with screenshots and
            arbitrary additional information generated out of your automated UI tests.
            The Scenarioo Docu Viewer web app lets you jump, almost like a kangaroo, through the steps of the tested scenarios.
            These scenarios are grouped by use case for ease of navigation.

        <h3>For Business, Development and Operations</h3>

        <p>
            Everybody involved in the development of your software can use the Scenarioo web app to browse
            comfortably inside the generated documentation. This is a common source of information and basis for
            collaboration for product owners, business analysts, product managers, requirements engineers, testers,
            supporters, developers and operations.

        <h3>Always Up to Date</h3>

        <p>
            Scenarioo is a living documentation that is generated and updated every night, when the automated
            UI tests run on your build server. Scenarioo turns your UI tests into a functional documentation of your
            software that is always in sync with what is currently implemented.

        <h3>UI Testing Toolkit Agnostic</h3>

        <p>
            Scenarioo provides a documentation format that is independent of your testing technology. It is possible to
            write Scenarioo XML files and screenshots from arbitrary UI testing toolkits and programming languages. For
            your convenience we provide a small Scenarioo Docu Writer library that helps writing the documentation files
            from your tests written in C#, Java and JavaScript.
