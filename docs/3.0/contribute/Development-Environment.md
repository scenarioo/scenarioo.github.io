# Development Environment

This page describes the setup of the development environment to develop the Scenarioo Viewer Webapplication and the Java and Javascript Writer Libraries.
 
 You have currently the following possible options to choose from:

**1. Setup IntelliJ to Develop (recommended)**: best for fast developing all javascript and java parts of Scenarioo in one place, see setup instructions here: [Development Environment with IntelliJ](Development-Environment-with-IntelliJ.md)

**2. Use the Virtual Machine:** (with WebStorm and Eclipse, not yet with IntelliJ) Contact the core development team if you want to use the same virtual machine to start more quickly. This virtual machine should contain all tools that are needed, and using it is described here: [Development Environment with VM](Development-Environment-with-VM.md)

**3. Setup Eclipse and Webstorms to develop** (old setup, same as on the Virtual Machine): the old setup, that still some developers use, is described here, but shouldnt be used anymore: [Development Environment with Eclipse and WebStorm](Development-Environment-with-Eclipse-And-WebStorm.md)

**4. Setup on Ubuntu:** (with WebStorm and Eclipse) There are some more specific setup instructions on how to setup more or less the same setup that we currently have in our virtual machine, you can find this setup here [Development Environment Setup on Ubuntu](Development-Environment-Setup-on-Ubuntu.md).
