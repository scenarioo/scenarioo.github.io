### Screenshots and unlimited information

Scenarioo can document the use cases and its user scenarios that your application provides with screenshots and arbitrary additional information, generated out of your automated UI tests.

### Allways up to date

Scenarioo is a living documentation that is generated and updated every night, when you run your automated UI tests on your build server.
  
### Accessible for all

The scenarioo webapplication lets all your different stakeholders browse comfortably in the generated documentation and find many useful information. This is a common source of information and basis for collaboration for your product owners, business analysts, product managers, requirements engineers, testers and developers.

### UI testing toolkit independent

Scenarioo provides a documentation format that is independent of your testing technology. It is possible to write Scenarioo XML files and screenshots from arbitrary UI testing toolkits. For C#, Java and JavaScript there is even a scenarioo docu writer library that you can use for writing the docu in your tests.
