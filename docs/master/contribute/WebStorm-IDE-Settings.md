# WebStorm Settings

## Enable ESLint checks

This makes sure you see the same ESLint warnings already in WebStorm that you would also see when running ESLint in the build.

    File -> Settings

    Languages & Frameworks -> JavaScript -> Code Quality Tools -> ESLint

## Disable EditorConfig

** TODO: this is probably old and outdated! We should use editorconfig, especially for Java code in IntelliJ!**

EditorConfig is buggy in WebStorm 9 and causes problems with the code formatter. As we don't use it anyway, just disable it.
