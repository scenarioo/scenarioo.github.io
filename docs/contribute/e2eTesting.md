# E2E Testing with Protractor

[Protractor](https://github.com/angular/protractor) is the UI testing tool for testing AngularJS apps. It uses [Selenium](http://www.seleniumhq.org/) to automate the browser.

To write your own e2e tests, check our example e2e scenarios in `scenarioo-client\test\protractorE2E\specs`.

For more infos on Protractor see [Protractor API documentation](http://angular.github.io/protractor/#/api).

## Run all e2e tests

### Prerequisites

 * Have a well configured and running Scenarioo server (Java backend)
   * The server has to use the newest version of demo configuration that is checked in here:  
     `scenarioo-server/src/main/resources/config-for-demo/config.xml`  
     You should copy the newest version of this file to your Scenarioo configuration directory before running the e2e tests.
   * Make sure you use the newest version of demo data generated by running JUnit tests in scenarioo-docu-generation-example before running the e2e tests (to be sure that there is now outdated old files it might be better to do a clean build of this project first!)
   * Make sure the configuration of your server has the directory configured to the directory where you generated the example demo data (change it accordingly!)

 * Have protractor installed (done in quickstart, by **npm install**)

 * Have the chrome webdriver installed (make sure your chromebrowser is up-to-date, > v30.x).
 This is done automatically if you use
 ```
 npm run pretest-e2e
 ```
 If there's a problem with the webdriver, try the following commands:
 
  On Unix systems:
  ```
  ./node_modules/protractor/bin/webdriver-manager update --chrome
  ```
  On Windows:
  ```
  node ./node_modules/protractor/bin/webdriver-manager update
  ```
  or
  ```  
  node node_modules\protractor\node_modules\webdriver-manager update
  ```

### Run the tests

Open your console and change into the client directory.

   ```
   cd scenarioo-client
   ```

Serve the client using gulp:

   ```
   npm start
   or
   gulp serve
   ```

Open a 2nd console and run the tests:

   ```
   gulp test-e2e-scenarioo
   ```

If you do not want to generate a scenarioo docu from the tests, run this:

   ```
   npm run test-e2e
   or
   gulp test-e2e
   ```

Gulp runs the e2e tests according to the config file `protractor-e2e.conf.js` (no Scenarioo documentation) or `protractor-e2e-scenarioo.conf.js` (with Scenarioo documentation).

This should open a new browser window, run all tests and log test-information to the console.
