# Scenarioo Version Numbers

We use version numbers as described in the [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) article.

Format: `x.y.z`

x = Major version, might have breaking changes in the library interfaces or in the scenarioo documentation file format.

y = Minor version, backwards compatible inside the same major version, but with additional new features

z = Patch version, just for fixes, backwards compatible inside major version, no new features
