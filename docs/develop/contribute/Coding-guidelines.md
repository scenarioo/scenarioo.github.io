# Coding Guidelines

## JavaScript

### ESLint

.js code has to conform to the checked in `.eslintrc` files. Configure your environment accordingly, see here for Webstorm: [WebStorm-IDE-Settings](WebStorm-IDE-Settings.md)

### Don't write 'use strict'; and don't wrap JS code with IIFEs

Our build adds this automatically to each *.js file.

### John Papa AngularJS Style Guide

Follow the [John Papa AngularJS Style Guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide).

We decided that the following rules are the most important ones and they must be obeyed whenever possible.

#### Folders-by-Feature Structure

Create folders named for the feature they represent. When a folder grows to contain more than 7 files, start to consider creating a folder for them. Your threshold may be different, so adjust as needed.

https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md#style-y152

#### Naming Guidelines

Use consistent names for all components following a pattern that describes the component's feature then its type: `feature.type.js`.

https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md#style-y120

#### Test File Names

Name test specifications similar to the component they test with a suffix of `spec`.

https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md#style-y122

#### Controller Names

Use consistent names for all controllers named after their feature. Use UpperCamelCase for controllers, as they are constructors.

https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md#style-y123

#### Controller Name Suffix

Append the controller name with the suffix `Controller`.

https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md#style-y124

#### Factory and Service Names

Use consistent names for all factories and services named after their feature. Use camel-casing for services and factories. Avoid prefixing factories and services with $. Suffix service and factories with Service.

https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md#style-y125

#### Directive Component Names

Use consistent names for all directives using camel-case. Use a short prefix to describe the area that the directives belong (some example are company prefix or project prefix). For Scenarioo we use the prefix `sc` (e.g. `scMetadataTree`).

https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md#style-y126

#### [implementation pending] Modules

When there are multiple modules, the main module file is named app.module.js while other dependent modules are named after what they represent. For example, an admin module is named admin.module.js. The respective registered module names would be app and admin.

https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md#style-y127

#### [implementation pending] Configuration

Separate configuration for a module into its own file named after the module. A configuration file for the main app module is named app.config.js (or simply config.js). A configuration for a module named admin.module.js is named admin.config.js.

https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md#style-y128

#### [implementation pending] Routes

Separate route configuration into its own file. Examples might be app.route.js for the main module and admin.route.js for the admin module. Even in smaller apps I prefer this separation from the rest of the configuration.

https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md#style-y129



#### Structure of Controllers:

0. general guideline: no inlined anonymous functions --> instead named functions, e.g. see UseCaseCtrl, resetSearchField etc.
1. `var vm = this;` - vm as an abreviation for "view model" (first line of controller code!)
2. then initialize all properties that are available on the view model, e.g. `vm.labelConfigurations = {};`
3. then assign all public functions (only the public ones!) on the view model, e.g. `vm.resetSearchField = resetSearchField;`
4. then call the activate function, which is responsible to initialize the controller / view model: `activate()`
5. all other initialization logic belongs inside the activate function (never directly inlined inside the controller function)
6. finally define all other controller logic functions (ordered top-down by their dependencies, as most comfortable for developers)

## CSS
* The prefix for our own CSS classes is `sc`.
  * Examples: `sc-tree`, `sc-node-label`

## Java
* Formatting and code style must conform to the Eclipse settings defined here: [Eclipse IDE Seetings](Eclipse-IDE-Settings.md)
* Follow the clean code reccommendations from the "Clean Code" book
* Order in a Java class:
  1. Fields
  2. Constructors
  3. Factory methods
  4. Getters / setters for properties
  5. Other methods
  6. hashCode / equals / toString
* Use constructor dependency injection. Make sure that classes with "business logic" get their dependencies injected, so that they are easily testable.
* Do not add the `serialVersionUID` to classes.

## C&#35;
* Formatting and code style must conform with settings defined here:
https://github.com/scenarioo/scenarioo-cs/blob/master/scenarioo-cs.sln.DotSettings

## Licence Headers
In every sourcefile (*.java, *.gradle, *.js, *.css, *.html,...) the correct licence header must be contained. In the versioned eclipse project the settings have been adjusted accordingly and new Java file while automatically contain the correct headers (depending on the module -server, -api and -docu-generation-example) for all other files (e.g. gradle files or properties) please always make sure that the correct header is included before adding to version control.

For the scenarioo-client module the code template settings (for *.js, *.css and *.html) in your favourite IDE must be configured by yourself (for WebStorms see below).
