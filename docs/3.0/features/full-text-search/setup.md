# Setup Scenarioo Full Text Search

Scenarioo Full Text Search is an optional feature, that is only
activated if your config.xml file points to a reachable
Elasticsearch instance.

## Install Elasticsearch

Please refer to the official documentation to set up Elasticsearch.
You can either install it on the same machine where you host Scenarioo
or on a separate machine.

## Configure Elasticsearch

By default `config.xml` does not contain an Elasticsearch endpoint
configuration. That's why the full text search feature is switched off.

In order to enable the full text search feature, add the 
`elasticSearchEndpoint` tag to the config.xml file and set the value
to the host and port of your Elasticsearch instance.

Here's an example using the default port of Elasticsearch:

```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<configuration>
    <elasticSearchEndpoint>localhost:9300</elasticSearchEndpoint>
    <!-- omitted other config tags -->
</configuration>
```

Restart Scenarioo after making manual changes to the config file.

## Check Elasticsearch Configuration and Status in Scenarioo

Go to Manage -> General Settings -> Full Text Search in order to 
check the Elasticsearch configuration and status.

## Calculate Search Indexes 

For making search available for a build you have to let scenarioo calculate its search index. This is done automatically, when a new build is published & imported to scenarioo.

But for making the search index also available for your old builds, that do not have a search index yet, you have to do following manual steps:

1. Go to: `Manage` / Tab `Builds`
2. Select `Reimport` (icon at the right end of a build row) for reimporting and calculating the index for a build
3. Wait until the import has completed
